This project comes about because of work which I have done with the FCKEditor html editor which while very good, doesn't always do the most thorough job of cleaning up text which is pasted into it (from Word for instance). I wanted a class which I could use to easily find and remove or replace a range of markup using Regular expressions which needed to be easily changed and added to via a config file.
